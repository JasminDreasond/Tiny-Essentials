# Tiny Essentials

**Tiny Essentials** is a collection of small, essential scripts designed to be used across various projects. These simple utilities are crafted for speed, ease of use, and versatility. From date calculations to formatting, object manipulations, and array operations, these scripts serve as building blocks for more complex applications.

## Features

- **Array Manipulations**: Functions like `shuffleArray` to randomize elements in place.
- **Time Calculations**: Easily calculate durations, format timers, and more.
- **Object Utilities**: Perform type checks, count object properties, and calculate percentages.
- **Custom Utilities**: Includes various helper functions like `ruleOfThree` for proportion calculations and `getAge` to calculate the age based on a given birth date.

## Installation

You can install Tiny Essentials via npm:

```bash
npm install tiny-essentials
```

Or download the scripts directly from this repository.

## Legacy Code

Some scripts in this repository have been preserved for backwards compatibility. These include modules like:

- `@tinypudding/firebase-lib`
- `@tinypudding/discord-oauth2`
- `@tinypudding/mysql-connector`
- `@tinypudding/puddy-lib`

These modules have been updated to work with modern environments but may not be actively developed further.

## Module Versions**
The core version of Tiny Essentials (version 1) is located in the folder [`/src/v1`](./src/v1).  

A detailed README is available inside the [`v1`](./src/v1) folder, which contains a full description of all utility modules and their functionalities.  
We recommend checking it out if you want to see all available tools in this version and how to use them individually or collectively via the `index.mjs` global module.
