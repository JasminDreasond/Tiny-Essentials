# Legacy Codes Folder

The **Legacy Codes** folder contains outdated code snippets that have been adapted to work with modern programming languages and environments. Despite their modernization, the original logic of all these codes has been preserved, regardless of whether the structure was well-organized or poorly structured.

### Key Points:
- **Original Logic Preserved:** All code retains its original functionality and structure, even if it was previously poorly organized or outdated.
- **Maintenance:** These codes will only receive updates for bug fixes or glitches when reported. No further improvements or new features will be added to them.
- **Feedback and New Versions:** Users can provide feedback, which may lead to the creation of updated versions. These new versions will be stored separately in the official code collection folder.

This folder is intended as a reference for legacy implementations that are no longer actively maintained but can still be useful for understanding older practices or for maintaining legacy systems.
