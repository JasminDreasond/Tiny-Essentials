## 🧭 How I Work with AI (Tips & Workflow)

Over time, I've built a personal workflow to make sure AI helps me *efficiently* — without ruining my focus, logic, or the structure of my code and documentation. Here are some habits and tricks I always follow:

* 📝 **Persistent Prompt Instructions**
  I noticed that AI often starts forgetting layout and formatting instructions after just a few messages. To prevent this, I keep a notepad with my core prompts and manually repeat key instructions every time I ask something, especially when working on documentation.

* ⚙️ **System Prompt Setup**
  One of my most effective strategies is maintaining a *System Instruction prompt* that defines the main behaviors I expect in **all my projects**. It includes things like:

  * Avoid adding humor or randomness
  * Always be 100% sincere and logical
  * Don’t include jsDoc descriptions unless I explicitly allow it (especially when I'm still working on a WIP feature)

* 🧠 **How I Talk to AI**
  I don’t try to talk to AI like it’s a person. I speak in a very natural, clear, and structured way — as if I were talking to a computer, because that’s what it is. This keeps things predictable and productive.

* 🔧 **Using the Chat History Interface Carefully**
  I frequently use history editing tools (when available) to fix incorrect messages and keep the whole conversation aligned and accurate. The cleaner the context, the better the answers — especially over long sessions.

* 🧹 **Avoiding Context Drift**
  The more you keep talking without resetting or correcting the prompt, the more likely it is that AI starts misunderstanding the conversation. So I always try to keep things clean and well-structured to preserve context.

* 📏 **Limit Code Size per Message**
  I avoid dumping extremely long blocks of code into the chat. Instead, I share only the relevant part or break the code into smaller, medium-sized chunks. This prevents confusion and makes it easier for AI to focus on what I actually need.

* 💬 **Managing Large Output Responses**
  If a reply needs to be very long, AI might break or compress the message too much to fit it into a single reply — and this often ruins the meaning or structure of the output. I always consider this when asking questions and sometimes break complex requests into smaller steps.
