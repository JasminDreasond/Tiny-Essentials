# 🚀 TinyThrottledApi Documentation

`TinyThrottledApi` is a professional-grade utility designed to manage asynchronous operations. It acts as a "gatekeeper" for your API calls, ensuring you do not overwhelm a server by sending too many requests at once (**Concurrency Control**) and helping you stay within rate limits (**Rate Throttling**).

## 🧠 Core Concepts

To use this library effectively, you must understand the two problems it solves:

### 1. Concurrency Control 🚦
If you try to fetch 1,000 items from a database simultaneously, your application might crash or the server might block your IP. 
**The Solution:** `TinyThrottledApi` limits the number of active requests. If the limit is 5, and you request 10, only 5 will run immediately; the other 5 will wait in a queue until a slot opens up.

### 2. Rate Throttling ⏱️
Even if you only run 5 requests at a time, sending them too quickly in "bursts" can trigger security filters.
**The Solution:** By integrating `TinyTimeout`, the API can introduce a dynamic delay between requests. This spreads the load over a longer period, making your traffic pattern look more natural and less aggressive.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation Context
This module expects the following dependencies to be present in your project structure:
* `tiny-essentials/libs/utils/TinyPromiseQueue` (For managing the waiting list).
* `tiny-essentials/basics/promiseUtils` (Specifically the `waitForTrue` function).
* `tiny-essentials/libs/math/TinyTimeout` (For regulating execution frequency).

### Basic Initialization
```javascript
import TinyThrottledApi from 'tiny-essentials/libs/utils/TinyThrottledApi';

// A mock API function to simulate a network request
const mockApi = async (id) => {
  console.log(`🚀 Fetching data for ID: ${id}`);
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(`Data ${id}`), 1000));
};

// Create an instance: Max 3 concurrent requests
const throttledApi = new TinyThrottledApi(3, mockApi);
```

## 🛠️ API Reference

### `constructor(concurrencyLimit, api, timeoutInstance)`
Initializes the throttled controller.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `concurrencyLimit` | `number` | Must be a positive integer. Defines max simultaneous tasks. |
| `api` | `Function` | The target asynchronous function to execute. |
| `timeoutInstance` | `TinyTimeout \| null` | (Optional) An instance to control request frequency. |

**Throws:**
* `TypeError`: If `concurrencyLimit` is not a positive number or `api` is not a function.

### `exec(...args)`
The primary method to execute your API calls.

* **Returns:** `Promise<ReturnType<API>>`.
* **Behavior:** 
  1. Checks if a slot is available.
  2. If yes, executes immediately.
  3. If no, adds the task to the `TinyPromiseQueue` and waits for a slot to become free.

### Getters (For Monitoring)
* `activeCount`: Returns the number of requests currently running.
* `queuedCount`: Returns the number of requests waiting in the queue.
* `concurrencyLimit`: Returns the current limit.
* `timeoutValue`: Returns the base delay in milliseconds.

## 💡 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Simple Concurrency (The "Batch" Pattern) 🚀
Use this when you have a large array of IDs and want to fetch data from a real API without overwhelming the client or the server. We use `JSONPlaceholder` (a free fake API) for this example.

```javascript
import TinyThrottledApi from 'tiny-essentials/libs/utils/TinyThrottledApi';

/**
 * A real-world fetch wrapper.
 * @param {number} id 
 * @returns {Promise<Object>}
 */
const fetchData = async (id) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${id}`);
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  
  return await response.json();
};

// Limit to 3 simultaneous network requests
const throttledApi = new TinyThrottledApi(3, fetchData);

async function runBatch() {
  const ids = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

  console.log("Starting batch fetch...");

  // Map IDs to promises managed by the throttled API
  const tasks = ids.map(id => 
    throttledApi.exec(id)
      .then(data => console.log(`✅ Success [ID ${id}]:`, data.title))
      .catch(err => console.error(`❌ Error [ID ${id}]:`, err.message))
  );

  await Promise.all(tasks);
  console.log("🏁 All batch tasks completed!");
}

runBatch();
```

### Example 2: Advanced Throttling (The "Polite" Pattern) ⏱️
Use this when the API you are calling has strict rate limits (e.g., "no more than 5 requests per second"). By using `TinyTimeout`, we ensure our requests are spaced out gracefully.

```javascript
import TinyThrottledApi from 'tiny-essentials/libs/utils/TinyThrottledApi';
import TinyTimeout from 'tiny-essentials/libs/math/TinyTimeout';

const fetchData = async (id) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${id}`);
  return await response.json();
};

// 1. Initialize the timing controller
const timeout = new TinyTimeout();

// 2. Create the throttled API
// We allow 2 concurrent requests, but we want to space them out
const throttledApi = new TinyThrottledApi(2, fetchData, timeout);

// 3. Configure the "politeness" delay
// Base delay of 1000ms (1 second) between requests
throttledApi.timeoutValue = 1000; 
// Maximum delay cap of 5000ms
throttledApi.timeoutLimit = 5000;

async function runPoliteBatch() {
  const ids = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  console.log("Starting polite batch fetch...");

  const tasks = ids.map(id => 
    throttledApi.exec(id).then(data => {
      console.log(`📦 Received ID ${id} at ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}`);
      return data;
    })
  );

  await Promise.all(tasks);
  console.log("🏁 Polite batch completed!");
}

runPoliteBatch();
```
