# 🎉 Tiny-Essentials v1.11.0 — The Notification Update! 🚨🔔

Tiny hi! We’re back with a super tiny fresh new version of **Tiny-Essentials**. :3

### 🌟 What's New in v1.11.0?

Say hello to **two new notification systems** that just landed in this release:

## 🛎️ TinyNotifyCenter

- **Dynamic notifications** with optional **titles**, **avatars**, and rich **HTML/text** content  
- Individual **close buttons** for each notification, plus a **clear all** button with a sleek broom icon 🧹  
- Mark notifications as **read/unread** with visual distinction  
- Clickable notifications with custom `onClick` handlers  
- Overlay with dimmed background and intuitive outside-click to close the notification list  
- Smooth animations on notification removal, preventing UI freezes  
- Live badge count that recalculates accurately from the DOM  
- Easy-to-use static template injection for instant integration

## 🎨 Design

The UI is minimal but expressive, placing the notification bell at the top-right corner, with a badge showing unread counts. Notifications appear in a clean list, with avatars for quick identification.

## ⚙️ Usage

Simply call `.add()` with your message or structured notification object, and watch your notifications come to life!
