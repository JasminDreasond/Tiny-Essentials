# Legacy codes update

Almost all legacy codes had the jsDocs fixed. I just didnâ€™t fix those from firebase because I think it will have version compatibility issues.
During this work I found that the `arraySortPositions` can be added to V1 of the official module, so now it is available in the `basics` category.
