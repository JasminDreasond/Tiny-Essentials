### ✨ Highlights

This release introduces **`TinyHtml`**, a new utility designed to simplify and empower DOM manipulation in a clean, chainable, and jQuery-inspired way.

### 📦 What's new

* **🧱 TinyHtml**

  * Lightweight and modern DOM utility class.
  * Provides intuitive methods for:

    * ✅ Element querying and traversal
    * 🎯 Event binding (`on`, `once`, `off`, `trigger`)
    * 🧩 Attribute and property management
    * 📏 Size and position handling (`offset`, `outerWidth`, etc.)
    * 🧲 Collision detection (including directional locking)
    * 👀 Viewport visibility checks (`isInViewport`, `isScrolledIntoView`)
    * 🗑️ DOM removal and utilities like `remove`, `index`, etc.
  * Fully supports both static and instance-based usage.

### 🛠️ Improvements & Internal

* Added internal event registry for better event management in `TinyHtml`.
* Enhanced compatibility for viewport and scroll calculations on `window`.
