### ✨ What's New

#### `TinyAfterScrollWatcher` gets smarter with `onStop()`! 🛑✨

You can now register functions to run **immediately after scrolling stops**, even **before** the `doAfterScroll()` queue is processed.

```js
watcher.onStop(() => {
  console.log('Scroll just stopped!');
});
```

Need to remove it later? You can do that too:

```js
watcher.offStop(myStopCallback);
```

---

### ✅ Summary

* ➕ **Added**: `onStop(fn)` — triggers functions immediately after scroll ends.
* ➕ **Added**: `offStop(fn)` — unregisters a previously added stop callback.
* 🔁 `onStop` runs **before** the `doAfterScroll` queue.

Enjoy the added precision! 🌀
