### ✨ New Features

* **TinyNeedBar**: Added two new tick methods for advanced control:

  * `tickWithTempFactor` — apply a temporary factor for a single tick without affecting the existing factors.
  * `tickSingleFactor` — execute a tick using only the specified factor, ignoring all others.
* **TinySimpleDice**: A new class added for simple dice rolling mechanics.
