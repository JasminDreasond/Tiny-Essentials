## âœ¨ UltraRandomMsgGen

* **Improved getters & setters**:
  The default word/emoji/noun/verb/adjective/template collections now provide **cloned arrays** through getters, ensuring immutability and safer usage in applications.
* **Safer setters with validation**:
  When updating these collections, the new setters enforce strict validation rules. They guarantee that only valid arrays of strings can be assigned, preventing empty or invalid states.
* These changes provide **better reliability and consistency** when customizing random message generation.

## ðŸ“œ TinyHtml

* **Enhanced jsDoc chain detection**:
  The chain detection system has been updated with a **new jsDoc structure**. This makes it easier to document, understand, and maintain chained methods within the TinyHtml environment.
* Developers now benefit from **clearer typing and improved integration** with editors and tooling that rely on jsDoc.
