### âœ¨ What's New

* **Event handling improvements in `TinyHtml`**
  The event trigger methods (`on`, `off`, `once`, and more.) now accept arrays of event names. This allows attaching a single callback to multiple events at once, making event management much more flexible.

* **New `select()` method in `TinyHtml`**
  Added support for programmatically selecting all text inside `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements via `TinyHtml.select(el)` or `el.select()`.
