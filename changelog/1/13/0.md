### 🚀 What's New

### 🕒 `TinyDomReadyManager`

A flexible DOM readiness manager built to go beyond `DOMContentLoaded`!

#### ✅ Key Features:

* 🔁 **Callback queue** with `priority`, `once`, and `filter` support
* ✨ **`domOnly` mode** to execute handlers immediately after the DOM is ready, skipping async waits
* ⏳ **Promise integration** — delays full readiness until all custom promises resolve
* 🧠 **Safe execution**, with internal try-catch for all filters and handlers
* 🔍 New `isReady()` and `isDomReady()` public methods to track current readiness state

#### 📘 Usage Example:

```js
manager.onReady(() => {
  console.log('DOM-only logic!');
}, { domOnly: true, priority: 10 });

manager.onReady(() => {
  console.log('Waits for external API...');
});

manager.addPromise(fetch('/api'));
manager.init();
```

### 🧪 Internal Notes

* Handlers are sorted by priority
* `domOnly: true` handlers always run first
* The system is considered fully ready only after:

  * DOMContentLoaded
  * All added promises resolved
