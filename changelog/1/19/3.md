### 🌟 Added

* **Versioned LocalStorage support** in `TinyLocalStorage` 🎉
  Now supports schema migration logic using a version number and `onUpgrade` callback, inspired by IndexedDB and SQL-style upgrades.

### ⚙️ Changes

* Added `updateStorageVersion(version, onUpgrade)` method:

  * Triggers upgrade callback when a new version is set.
  * Throws on version downgrade to prevent accidental data loss.
* Internally tracks version using the same `LSDB::`-based key naming strategy.
* Adds protection against overwriting reserved `LSDB::` keys.
