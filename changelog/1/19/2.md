## 🛡️ Safer Custom Types

This patch release brings security and consistency improvements to the custom JSON type system of TinyLocalStorage! 🔐✨

### 🔧 What's Changed

* **🧊 `freezeType` flag added to `registerJsonType()`**
  You can now freeze custom types to prevent them from being accidentally overwritten or removed.

* **❌ Secure deletion control**
  `deleteJsonType()` now throws an error if you try to delete a frozen type. No more silent mistakes! 🛑

* **🕵️‍♀️ New helper: `hasJsonType()`**
  Quickly check if a type is already registered.

* **🔒 `getString()` now safely serializes values**
  Improved internal handling ensures safer string output for objects, special types, and edge cases — preventing unexpected runtime issues or unsafe output formatting.

### ⚠️ Security Notes

These changes prevent accidental or malicious tampering with critical type behavior by allowing type freezing and validation before registration. Perfect for safely extending JSON logic in shared environments!
