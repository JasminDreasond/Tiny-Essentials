## What's New in TinyHtml
✨ The internal `_appendChecker` now supports **recursive arrays of any depth**. You can pass nested arrays of elements, and they will be inserted in the correct order.

**Highlights:**

* 🔁 Unlimited recursive array support for `append` and `prepend`
* 🚀 More powerful and predictable element insertion
