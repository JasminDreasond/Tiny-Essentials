## 📦 Changes

### 🔹 TinyHtml

* **`setAttr`** now accepts **numbers** as values in addition to strings.
* **`setProp`** method added for setting element properties directly.
* New **`elements` getter** introduced for retrieving all elements.

  * ⚠️ **Deprecated:** `getAll()` is now deprecated in favor of `elements`.

---

### 🔹 TinyEvents

* Added support for **multi-event strings**.

  * All event-related methods (`on`, `once`, `off`, `offAll`, `prependListener`, etc.) now accept both:

    * a single event name (`"click"`)
    * an array of event names (`["click", "hover"]`)

---

## ⚠️ Deprecations

* `TinyHtml.getAll()` → Use the new `elements` getter instead.

---

## ✅ Upgrade Notes

* Existing code using `getAll()` will still work, but you should migrate to `elements` to avoid future issues.
* Event handling just got easier: you can now pass multiple event names in a single call.
