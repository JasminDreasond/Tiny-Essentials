### ðŸ”§ Added

* Introduced a **new element debugging system** in `TinyHtml`.

  * Developers can now enable `TinyHtml.elemDebug = true` to receive **detailed console diagnostics** whenever element validation fails.
  * Debug output includes:

    * A clear error header for context
    * A **stack trace** to identify the call site
    * A structured **console.table** showing all elements involved (index, type, constructor, and summary)
    * A focused view of the **problematic element** using `console.dir`

### ðŸŽ¯ Why it matters

This new debugging layer makes it much easier to identify invalid or unexpected elements during DOM construction, event wiring, and custom element handling.

### âœ… Impact

* No breaking changes.
* Debugging is **disabled by default**.
* To use, simply enable:

  ```js
  TinyHtml.elemDebug = true;
  ```
