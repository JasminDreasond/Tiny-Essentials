### ✨ New Features

* **TinyHtml → `fadeTo`**
  A new animation utility has been added to smoothly transition an element’s opacity to a specific value.

  * Supports both static and instance usage.
  * Accepts numeric durations, named speeds (`"fast"`, `"slow"`, etc.), or full `KeyframeAnimationOptions`.
  * Automatically makes hidden elements visible before animating.

**Example:**

```js
TinyHtml.fadeTo(el, 0.5, 400);       // Fade element to 50% opacity in 400ms
element.fadeTo(1, "slow");           // Instance method: fade to full opacity with predefined speed
```
