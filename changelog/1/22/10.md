## What's New

* 🏗 **TinyHtml internal `has`** now returns an array of `Element[]` instead of a single value, making DOM queries more consistent and predictable.
* 🔧 **`_appendChecker` expanded**: it now supports objects directly, giving you more flexibility when building and structuring your content.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notice ⚠️
The behavior of **`element.has`** has changed!
It **no longer returns a boolean** as in past versions.
Now it will always return an **array of `Element[]`**.

> If you relied on a boolean check, make sure to update your code accordingly.
