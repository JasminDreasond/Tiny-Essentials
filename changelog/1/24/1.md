## ðŸ“¦ Legacy Code Migration

All legacy content (except for the parts that have been reused) has been moved to a **new dedicated repository**.
You can find the link and details inside the main projectâ€™s `README.md`.

## ðŸ”§ TinyHtml Updates

Weâ€™ve simplified property access for better readability and consistency:

* `el.id()` â†’ `el.id`
* `el.height()` â†’ `el.height`
* `el.width()` â†’ `el.width`
