## 🛠️ Import Optimization!

This is a small but meaningful update focused on **performance and modularity**. We’ve moved two utility functions — `countObj` and `isJsonObject` — from `objFilter.mjs` into a new, dedicated file: `objChecker.mjs`.

### ✨ What's changed:

* ♻️ **Refactored**: `countObj` and `isJsonObject` are now in their own module: `objChecker.mjs`.
* 📁 This change helps reduce overhead by allowing more granular imports when using tree-shaking or custom bundlers.

No logic was changed — just cleaner structure and better control over what you load!
